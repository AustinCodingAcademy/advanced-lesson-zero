My final project concept is a Appointment Book that will allow users to pick the first available date/time for an appointment in an office.
User will do this through a secure login portal.
User will be allowed to choose the office or have the app find nearest location to them.
Once user appointment is booked then office is notified.
User will sign in at the office using a kiosk that is an tablet.
when check-in is complete a notification is sent to staff to alert customer has arrived.
