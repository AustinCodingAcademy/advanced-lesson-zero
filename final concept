Final Project Concept-

Goal Tracker-
The user picks a goal from a list or creates a custom goal such as a career change or just general personal improvement. 
The app will track progress and reward the user similar to a role-playing game. 
The app would feel like you are simply playing a game as a character but you will be making real life progress simultaneously.
The rewards for reaching smaller "micro goals" would be coupons to certain stores or areas of interest that the user can input, or the rewards /coupons 
can be automatically targeted towards the user based on his or her goal.
An example would be if the user has a goal of fitness improvement, the reward could be a coupon for new running shoes to a local sports store.

Local Allergy updates-
An app that can tell the user what specific allergens are most active in the air on that particular day in their area. 
This will allow the user to see what type of allergen they are most allergic to. Such as pollen, mold or cedar.
